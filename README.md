## n8n-docker-extension

A simple [docker extension](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions/) for [n8n](https://n8n.io/) , n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.
